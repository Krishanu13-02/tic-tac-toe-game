# tic-tac-toe-game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is designed to be played by two players, taking turns to mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X and O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game, demonstrating basic game logic and web development skills. This project is suitable for beginners like me who want to practice coding by building a simple yet engaging game.

## Features
- Player vs Player mode
- Automatic detection of wins and draws
- Option to reset the game after each round
- Simple and intuitive web interface

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game layout
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and interactivity

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Krishanu13-02/tic-tac-toe.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tic-tac-toe`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.

## How to Play
- Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) in an empty cell on the grid.
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Code Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic
- `README.md`: Project documentation
